# Attack_Anything: A Framework for Adversarial Attacks on Object Detection Models

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper **Attack_Anything**, a comprehensive framework for generating robust adversarial examples to attack various object detection models. Our framework is designed to be flexible, extensible, and easy to use, supporting a wide range of state-of-the-art object detectors.

## Introduction

Recent advancements in deep learning have led to remarkable progress in object detection. However, the vulnerability of these models to adversarial attacks raises significant security concerns. This project provides a framework to systematically study and evaluate the robustness of object detection models against various adversarial attack methods.

"Attack_Anything" allows for the generation of adversarial patches and perturbations that can cause object detectors to fail in identifying objects, misclassify them, or produce incorrect bounding boxes.

## Key Features

*   **Wide Range of Supported Models**: Supports numerous object detection architectures, including YOLOv3, YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, DETR, and many more through integration with MMDetection.
*   **Multiple Attack Algorithms**: Implementation of various adversarial attack techniques.
*   **Customizable Configurations**: Easily configure attacks, models, and datasets through a comprehensive configuration system.
*   **Extensible Framework**: Designed to be easily extended with new models, datasets, and attack methods.
*   **Evaluation Tools**: Tools for evaluating the performance of attacks and the robustness of models.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JiaweiLian/Attack_Anything.git
    cd Attack_Anything
    ```

2.  **Create a Conda environment and activate it:**
    ```bash
    conda create -n attack_anything python=3.8 -y
    conda activate attack_anything
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    Install PyTorch and torchvision following the [official instructions](https://pytorch.org/).
    ```bash
    # Example for CUDA 11.3
    pip install torch==1.12.1+cu113 torchvision==0.13.1+cu113 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
    ```
    Install other dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: A `requirements.txt` file should be created to list all dependencies such as `mmcv`, `mmdet`, `numpy`, etc.)*

## Usage

### Training

To train a model, use the `train.py` script with a specific model configuration file.

```bash
python train.py --config configs/yolo/yolov3.yaml
```

### Generating Adversarial Patches

To generate an adversarial patch, you can use a script like `generate_patch.py` (assuming one exists or will be created) and specify the attack configuration.

```bash
python generate_patch.py --config configs/attacks/patch_attack.yaml
```

### Evaluating Attacks

To evaluate the effectiveness of an attack on a dataset, you can run an evaluation script.

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_config configs/yolo/yolov3.yaml --attack_config configs/attacks/patch_attack.yaml
```

## Supported Models

Our framework supports a wide variety of models from the MMDetection toolbox and other sources. Some of the supported models include:

*   Faster R-CNN
*   RetinaNet
*   Mask R-CNN
*   Cascade R-CNN
*   SSD
*   YOLOv3, YOLOv5, YOLOX
*   DETR
*   And many more...

Please refer to the `configs` directory for a complete list of supported models and their configurations.
